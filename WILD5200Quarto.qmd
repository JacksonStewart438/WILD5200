This shows the epidemiological triad, which shows the relationship between pathogens their host and the environment. A very powerful symbol in epidemiology, often referenced.

##Worksheet 2

![1) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a\
herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.](images/clipboard-2552825706.png)

[**##The sample size necessary is 59 deer**]{.underline}

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the\
following scenarios:\
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

[**##299 samples are needed**]{.underline}\
b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

[**##229 samples are needed**]{.underline}

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the\
300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this\
finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is\
\_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%.

## Worksheet 3 

**Definitions:** - **Incidence** = number of **new cases** on a specific day รท number of **susceptible animals** at the start of that day.

Unit: *cases per elk per day*

**Prevalence** = number of **existing cases** on a specific day รท **total herd size**.

Unit: *proportion of elk*

## a) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

06/12/25 : 5 new cases / 51 at risk = 9.8%

06/14/25 : 2 new cases / 44 at risk = 4.5%

06/15/25 0 new cases / 44 at risk = 0%

## b) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence

06/13/25 : 12 infected / total herd = 21.4%

06/16/25 : 5 infected / total herd = 8.9%

## c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

on 6/10/25 both prevalence and incidence were the same, based on the same elk. Prevalence was 1/56 and so was incidence.

## d) On which day is the incidence lowest?

On both 06/15/25 and 06/16/25 there are no new cases. Meaning that the incidence in both days is 0.00%. So the answer would have to be 06/15/25 since it is the first day with no new cases.
