This shows the epidemiological triad, which shows the relationship between pathogens their host and the environment. A very powerful symbol in epidemiology, often referenced.

##Worksheet 2

![1) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a\
herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.](images/clipboard-2552825706.png)

[**##The sample size necessary is 147 individuals**]{.underline}

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the\
following scenarios: \
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

[**##299 samples are needed**]{.underline}\
b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

[**##229 samples are needed**]{.underline}

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the\
300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this\
finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is\
\_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%.

\##[**\<1%**]{.underline}
