# Worksheet 2

## 1) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

[**##The sample size necessary is 59 deer**]{.underline}

## 2) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

\
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

[**##299 samples are needed**]{.underline}\
b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

[**##229 samples are needed**]{.underline}

## 3) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%.

\##[**\<1%**]{.underline}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Worksheet 3

**Definitions:** - **Incidence** = number of **new cases** on a specific day ÷ number of **susceptible animals** at the start of that day.

Unit: *cases per elk per day*

**Prevalence** = number of **existing cases** on a specific day ÷ **total herd size**.

Unit: *proportion of elk*

## a) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

06/12/25 : 5 new cases / 51 at risk = 9.8%

06/14/25 : 2 new cases / 44 at risk = 4.5%

06/15/25 0 new cases / 44 at risk = 0%

## b) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence

06/13/25 : 12 infected / total herd = 21.4%

06/16/25 : 5 infected / total herd = 8.9%

## c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

on 6/10/25 both prevalence and incidence were the same, based on the same elk. Prevalence was 1/56 and so was incidence.

## d) On which day is the incidence lowest?

On both 06/15/25 and 06/16/25 there are no new cases. Meaning that the incidence in both days is 0.00%. So the answer would have to be 06/15/25 since it is the first day with no new cases.

## Question 7:

In 2015, 200,000 Saiga antelope died due to an infection caused by the bacteria *Pasteurella multocida.* This bacteria is naturally occurring in the antelopes lungs and is usually considered as harmless to their health. However in 2015, during the Saiga calving season, which traditionally has the hottest months, something changed. The normally harmless bacteria, turned pathogenic, leading to hemorrhagic septicemia. In simple terms, hemorrhagic septicemia, leads to internal bleeding and death within hours to days. Saiga antelope are herd animals, sticking close together for resources and protection from predators. Hemorrhagic septicemia can be spread through bodily fluids as well as contaminated soil and water. So this time, the herd did not protect them from predators, but ended up being more dangerous due to the close quarter contact they always have. This combination of a highly contagious disease, along with thousands of animals being close together, has lead to the 200,000 deaths. A few strategies could be used in order to prevent a similar event. Since this outbreak was partially caused due to the increase in temperature and moisture, i think it is safe to say we need increased weather monitoring in that area to prepare for the next outbreak. This goes hand in hand with basic disease surveillance, which would be necessary to track and monitor the spread of the disease and prevent an outbreak. Habitat management as well as ethical hunting to keep population levels safe should also help maintain a healthy less diseased population. On a broader scale, trying to prevent Saiga from extinction due to disease the same foundations of diseases monitoring and prevention will remain the same. Some big picture ideas could be maintaining multiple herds of Saiga that are genetically distinct from each other, maybe leading to a disease resistant herd but at the bottom line preventing a mass extinction. Policy is going to have to be a big part of that as well, anti poaching laws or more strict hunting laws. I know a lot of people in that area rely on the Saiga as a source of food, so that could be difficult. Lastly I would recommend more climate change research, as this is partially what caused the outbreak. If temperatures keep going up, hemorrhagic septicemia in Saiga Antelope will not be our biggest problem.

## Question 9:

R~0~ is the average number of new infections caused by one infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. It helps to determine how easily disease can spread. So in scenario 1 you see one red (infected) and one blue (susceptible) flamingo making R~0~ = 1. In scenario two there is one red and three blue, making R~0~ equal 3, since the disease will likely spread to 3 individuals. For scenario 3 R~0~ = 2 and for scenario 4 R~0~ is equal to zero since there are no susceptible people to be infected. In a real world sense, R~0~ is used to predict and manage disease spread. If R~0~ is greater than 1 than the disease is likely to grow unless action is taken. If R~0~ is less than 1 than the opposite can be said, that the disease will most likely die out. R~0~ is a fundamental way of understanding disease spread, and helps to predict disease behavior.

# Worksheet 4

## 1) MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations?

False, MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in camel populations.

## 2) Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV?

True

## 3) Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV?

True, even though there have been reports of human to human transmission, it is very rare making humans considered dead end hosts.

## 4) The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%?

False, the case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV is 35%

## 5) The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak?

False, the epidemic curve indicates that this is a repeated outbreak. It frequently repeats itself and does not have one big outbreak point. There are multiple peaks that show multiple outbreaks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Worksheet 5

## 1) Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

According to Fenton and Pedersen's community epidemiology framework, an emerging infectious disease is one that has newly appeared in a population or is rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range, while spillover events occur when a pathogen maintained in a reservoir host crosses in a new host species.

When it comes to the Marburg Virus in Rwanda, the reservoir host is the cave bats. In this case a human was infected after likely visiting one of these caves. That alone would make this a case of spillover, since the reservoir host passed it onto a non normal host.

Though we were also told that there are now 66 confirmed cases of Marburg virus in humans in Rwanda. So if the incidence is increasing and the geographical range is most likely also increasing, then that makes it an emerging infectious diseases.

So while I would call this a spillover initiated outbreak, I would also be comfortable calling it an emerging infectious disease, since it has all of the traits for both based on the Fenton and Pendersen framework.

## 2) What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

This specific strain of Marburg that has broken out in Rwanda has a 23% mortality rate (15/66 have died), meaning community and healthcare prevention is super important. That being said, there is a lot we can do, starting with community management. You have to reduce human to bat contact as that is what has seemed to cause this outbreak in the first place. That goes hand in hand with my next point of public health education. You have to tell the community about the risks, show them the data, and talk about the deaths, they have to know the importance of the outbreak. With such a fatal disease, you have to teach things like safe burial, issoloation, and contact tracing. All of these things are essential in reducing outbreak risks.

In a healthcare setting it is a little easier to implement risk reduction since you are generally surrounded by trained like minded people with a common goal. Healthcare workers will need PPE, including respirators, protective clothing, face mask/ shield, anything that will keep the healthcare workers safe. In this outbreak it states that most of the confirmed cases are in hospital workers, meaning they need some better training. Which leads me to my next point, training. This is obviously not a super common problem in humans, so how many people are actually hazmat trained, or know what to do in a situation like that. The hospital will need to set up isolation wings, keeping all patients in staff in that area only as to not spread through the hospital. It is also the hospitals responsibility to have safe disposal of infected waste so that nothing outside of the hospital will become infected from it. There are endless things that i can think of that a hospital can do in order to prevent or reduce risk of infection. That being said they are all pretty similar with the idea of being smart, being prepared, and stopping the spread of disease.

# Worksheet 6

##  1) A new disease, Vertico, has been detected in fish in two separate ponds. Your task is to analyze the sample data to determine and compare the disease prevalence between the two ponds.

## 2) For each pond, report the following: • Prevalence (%) • 95% CI (%) • Fisher’s exact test p-value • Interpretation (Is the difference statistically significant?)

## Answer)

For pond 1 the reported prevalence was 30% with a 95% CI \[14-52.5\]. In pond 2 there was a prevalence of 7% with a 95% CI \[0.3 - 30.2\]. The p-value was reported at 0.1987, meaning the differences are not statistically significant.

# Worksheet 7

## 1) Nipah Virus ) Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive measures recommended in each setting

In Malaysia the human outbreak of Nipah Virus mostly involved intermediate hosts. Fruit bats were the natural reservoir, and they transmitted the virus to pigs via direct and indirect contact. These infected pigs were then responsible for infecting humans.

In Bangladesh, the dominant mode of spillover was direct bat to human transmission due to consuming date palm sap that had been contaminated with bat urine, saliva, or droppings.

So in Malaysia, the epidemic was driven by pig farmers, compared to in Bangladesh where it was driven by human behavior (eating date palm sap). Prevention in Malaysia would look like increased biosecurity in pig farms, avoiding feeding pigs fruit from areas with high bat populaitons, and isolation of sick animals. In Bangladesh you would need to stop eating the palm sap, or protect the sap from bats maybe in the form of a tree skirt. Education is also important for both communities in order to stop the spread of disease.

## 2) Avian Reovirus) Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affected population.

Avian reovirus is transmitted in several ways. The two major categories are horizontal and vertical. Horizontal transmission would be things like the fecal oral route, so an infected bird excretes virus in droppings, another bird ingests contaminated droppings and becomes infected. Vertical transmission is when a hen passes the infection to a chick while in the egg.

Environmental factors play a huge role in the spread of ARV. Industrial pultry farms often see dense populations of poultry in small spaces which force contact with other poultry. This dense population of birds combined with the often unsanitary living conditions, shared bedding, food, and water, leads to an increase in horizontal transmissions in these environments.

A pathogen characteristic that allows ARV to thrive in these environments is the fact that ARVs are non enveloped. Meaning they can survive in litter, water, on surfaces for extended periods, which aids spread, especially in cool and wet conditions.

An example of ARV is Tenosynovitis in poultry. It causes lameness, swollen joints, ruptured gastrocnemius tendons, reduced mobilit, ruffled feathers, and reultance to move. It decreases growth rates and feed efficiency, increases culling, causes major economic losses in poultry operations and can lead to secondary infections and high morbidity.

## 3) Langya Henipavirus) Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?

The likely reservoir of LayV is the shrew, which is a small rodent much like a mouse. The shrew population studied in China had a 27% prevalence leading us to believe that they are the natural reservoir for the disease. The main route of transmission is believed to be direct contact with wildlife. There have been no significent or studied cases of sustained human to human transmission. Meaning this disease, which is caused from spillover from the shrew population is classified as a spillover and not an emerging infectious disease.

# Worksheet 8

Across all 106 raccoons, the total prevalence of Baylisascaris procyonis infection was 47.17%, with a 95% confidence interval of 37.66%–56.67%.

Raccoons in the North region had 28.57% prevalence (95% CI: 15.92–41.22%), while raccoons in the Central region had 64.29% prevalence (95% CI: 39.19–89.39%), and those in the South region had 62.79% prevalence (95% CI: 48.32–77.24%).\
This shows that Central and South have more than double the prevalence of North, suggesting much higher environmental transmission in those regions.

Across all raccoons, females had 64.86% prevalence (95% CI: 49.48–80.25%), while males had 37.68% prevalence (95% CI: 26.25–49.12%).Females overall have much higher prevalence than males, suggesting stronger or more frequent exposure.

In the North region, females had 38.10% prevalence (95% CI: 17.32–58.87%), while males had 21.43% prevalence (95% CI: 6.23–36.63%).In the Central region, females had 100% prevalence (95% CI: 100–100%), while males had 44.44% prevalence (95% CI: 11.98–76.91%).In the South region, females had 100% prevalence (95% CI: 100–100%), while males had 50.00% prevalence (95% CI: 32.68–67.32%).In Central and South, every female was infected, and males were consistently lower in all regions.

Adults had 52.17% prevalence (95% CI: 40.39–63.96%), while young adults had 37.84% prevalence (95% CI: 22.21–53.47%).Adults showed higher prevalence than young adults overall, consistent with longer exposure over time.Adult females had 100% prevalence (95% CI: 66.12–100.55%), while young adult females had 46.15% prevalence (95% CI: 24.92–69.82%).\
Adult males had 46.81% prevalence (95% CI: 27.67–54.68%), while young adult males had 23.53% prevalence (95% CI: 7.09–48.47%).This shows that adult females had extremely high infection across all regions, and adult males had roughly double the prevalence of young adult males.

This dataset reveals strong spatial and demographic patterns in Baylisascaris procyonis infection. Central and South regions clearly exhibit higher prevalence than the North, indicating more favorable environmental conditions for egg survival or higher raccoon densities that increase transmission. Females consistently showed higher prevalence than males, and adults had higher infection than young adults, both pointing toward behavioral and exposure-related differences. Adult females were the most heavily infected group overall.

# Worksheet 9 

## 1) In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in the United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic spread of Salmonella? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain why these behaviors facilitated human infection. 

During the 2024 salmonella outbreak, several specific human behaviours amoung backyard poultry owners directly contributed to zoonotic transmission. Many owners handled their chickens or collected eggs and ate them, drank, or touched their face without washing their hands. Because salmonella commonly contaminates feathers, feet, and fecal material, skipping proper hand hygiene allowed bacteria to move easily from the birds to human mucos membranes. Another behavior that increased risk was allowing poultry to enter homes or shared living spaces. When chicks or adult birds were brought indoors, the birds contaminated carpets, and counters,creating widespread environmental exposure that persisted long after the birds were removed. A third major factor was the tendency for people, especially children, to kiss, cuddle, or hold birds close to their faces. Physical closeness placed contaminated feathers or beaks near the mouth, nose, and eyes, which is one of the most efficient pathways for zoonotic Salmonella infection. Additional practices such as children under 5 handling birds unsupervised or cleaning poultry equipment in kitchen sinks further increased exposure. Together, these behaviors created repeated opportunities for humans to ingest or contact Salmonella, driving the outbreak.

## 2) Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (Epichloë coenophiala) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in grazing livestock.

\
a. What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal\
endophyte?

Tall fescue gains ecological advantages from its association with the fungal Ephicole coenophilia. The eondopyte produces aljaloids that protects the plant from insect herbivory and grazing pressure, allowing it to survive and persist longer than non-infected grasses. It also enhances the plant’s tolerance to environmental stressors such as drought, heat, and nutrient-poor soils. These combined benefits allow tall fescue to outcompete neighboring species and maintain dominance in many pasture systems.

\
b. What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of\
fescue toxicosis in grazing systems?

The severity of fescue toxicosis in grazing systems is shaped by several environmental and ecological factors. Pasture endophyte infection rates play a major role because higher infection levels correspond with higher concentrations of ergot alkaloids consumed by livestock. Environmental stress also increases alkaloid production; conditions such as heat, drought, or overgrazing push the plant into producing more toxic compounds. Seasonal patterns are important as well as alkaloid concentrations are highest during late spring and summer when Tall fescue is actively growing. Finally, grazing pressure and forage availability influence exposure. When cattle have fewer forage options, they tend to consume more stems and seedheads, the parts of the plant with the greatest alkaloid content, which ultimately worsens clinical disease.

\
c. What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle?

Cattle experiencing fescue toxicosis typically show reduced weight gain, poor heat tolerance, and decreased milk production. Affected animals often exhibit elevated body temperature, rough hair coats, and general lethargy due to impaired thermoregulation caused by vasoconstriction. In more severe cases, cattle may develop “fescue foot,” which includes reduced blood flow to extremities, lameness, and tissue necrosis. These signs collectively reflect the systemic effects of ergot alkaloids on vascular and endocrine function.

# Worksheet 10 

## 1) What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF?

African Swine Fever spreads through several routes, including direct contact between infected and healthy pigs, contact with contaminated blood or bodily fluids, and exposure to contaminated equipment, clothing, feed, or vehicles. Humans play a major role in spreading ASF because they move pigs, pork products, and contaminated materials between farms. The virus survives well on boots, tools, trucks, and feed, so poor biosecurity, illegal transport of pork, and not disinfecting equipment are major drivers of human-mediated spread.

## 2) Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity, progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas.

Koalas infected with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) experience more severe cases of Chlamydia because KoRV weakens the immune system. This makes koalas less able to control the bacterial infection, leading to faster disease progression, more frequent systemic infections, and higher rates of blindness, infertility, and urinary disease. Co-infection also complicates management because antibiotics work more slowly, relapse is more common, and KoRV-positive animals require more supportive care. Overall, KoRV makes Chlamydia infections harder to treat and more harmful to the population.

## 3. Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, is an emerging threat to wild snake populations in North America. What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease (SFD)? 

Surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease are difficult for several reasons. Wild snakes are naturally hard to detect and sample, so determining true prevalence is challenging. The disease also presents differently across species and environments, making early detection inconsistent. Environmental reservoirs of the fungus complicate control because snakes can become re-infected from soil or habitat even after treatment. Finally, there are limited treatment options for wild snakes, and applying antifungals at a population scale is not practical. These factors make SFD a complex and ongoing management issue.
